## TL;DR

- You all are smart and brilliant people
- Don’t beat yourself up while learning
- Find your crew who you can learn with safely
- When possible, make things public

## My Advice to Grow as a Data Scientist

1. Have Values
2. Meet people 
3. Learn Things Together
4. Build Things Together
5. Take Care of Yourself
6. Share Things

# 1.  Have Values

## Why Values?

- Values help you say yes
- Values Help you say no 

## My Values

- Curiosity (about learning and others)
- Compassion (for myself and others)

## There is more than one path

- Question the PI model
- Collaboration is the most important

## Be Compassionate and Gentle With Yourself

- Data Science is Hard
- Don’t Replay Negative Tapes
- Find people to Learn With

## The 5 minute rule for learning

- If something doesn't make sense, take a walk or a break and come back to it.

## It's Dangerous to Learn Alone

- Use Social Learning to learn faster 
- Having a group makes things easier

# 2. Meet People

## Who Should You Meet?

- Potential Collaborators
- Potential Employers
- "Weak Ties"

## An Introvert’s Guide to Networking

- Networking is not about promoting yourself
- It’s about being curious about other people
- Finding common ground and seeing if you want to work with them

[How to Network in a Non-slimy Way](https://laderast.github.io/articles/2021-09-13-how-to-network-in-a-non-slimy-way/how-to-network-in-a-non-slimy-way.html)

## Be Curious About Other People

- Practice Informational Interviewing
- Don't overthink your questions
- Be genuinely interested in what people do
- Don't limit yourself to your field

## Do or Attend Lightning Talks!

- Lightning talk: 5-10 minute invitation to chat
- Best way to advertise what you're interested in
- Best way to meet people with your same interests

## Volunteer at Conferences

- Low-key way to meet people
- Working on things together is super helpful

## Should You Collaborate?



# 3. Learn Things Together

## Start or Join a Group!

- Find your like minded peers
- Help each other learn
- Find groups that have Codes of Conduct

## Why are Codes of Conduct Important?

- Establish the tone for the group
- States unacceptable behavior

>  Having [you] talk over the content providing examples and also answering student related questions was really helpful to see how some queries I had, others were having, which you explained, sometimes even providing more than one solution. Thanks very much. I have developed a passion for R.
