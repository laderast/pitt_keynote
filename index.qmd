## TL; DR

- You all are smart and brilliant people
- Don’t beat yourself up while learning
- Find your crew who you can learn with safely
- When possible, make things public

## My Advice to Grow as a Data Scientist

1. Have Values
2. Meet people 
3. Learn Things Together
4. Build Things Together
5. Take Care of Yourself
6. Share Things in Public

# 1.  Have Values

## Why Values?

- Values help you say yes
- Values Help you say no 

## My Values

- Curiosity (about learning and others)
- Compassion (for myself and others)

## There is more than one path

- Question the PI model
- Collaboration is the most important

## Be Compassionate and Gentle With Yourself

::::{.columns}

- Data Science is Hard
- Don’t Replay Negative Tapes
- Find people to Learn With

## Learning Self-Talk from Students

> It’s okay not to know how to do something, practice makes perfect!

> It will be hard to learn, but so much fun and worth it.

> Dedicate couple hours for practice a day

## Learning Self-Talk

> It's going to be okay, it's really overwhelming right now but Ted is patient and thorough. 

> It's a good thing that you're looking at multiple sources of information about R (i.e. a brief Code Academy stint, the KCRB R4DS group, R Bootcamp links), it will just serve to solidify the topics that get covered. 

> Don't forget to Google, remember to ask questions.


## This is What it Takes

## The 5 minute rule for learning

- If something doesn't make sense, take a walk or a break and come back to it.

## It's Dangerous to Learn Alone

::::{.columns}
:::{.column}
- Use Social Learning to learn faster 
- Having a group makes learning easier

# 2. Meet People

## Who Should You Meet?

- Fellow Learners!
- Potential Collaborators
- Potential Employers
:::{.fragment}
- "Weak Ties"

## An Introvert’s Guide to Networking

:::{.incremental}
- Networking is not about promoting yourself
- It’s about being curious about other people
- Finding common ground and seeing if you want to work with them

# 3. Learn Things Together

## Compassion = Psychological Safety

> Psychological safety is being able to show and employ one's self without fear of negative consequences of self-image, status or career.

## Psychological Safety -> Effective Learning

You need to find it for yourself

## Start or Join a Group!

- Find your like minded peers
- Help each other learn
- Find groups that have Codes of Conduct

## Why are Codes of Conduct Important?

- Establish the tone for the group
- States unacceptable behavior

## Example: OHSU BioData Club

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- Started as a group that wanted to learn more data science
- Everyone is Equal (PhD, Postdoc, Faculty)
- Working through problems together

# Expressing my Gratitude

## Thank You (ggplot version)

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
gratitude <- readr::read_csv("gratitude.csv") |> arrange(First)
col_num <- rep(1:6, each=21)[1:nrow(gratitude)]
row_num <- rep(seq(1:21), 6)[1:nrow(gratitude)]
gratitude <- gratitude |> mutate(name=paste(First, Last), 
                                 col_num = col_num, row_num=-row_num) 

ggplot(gratitude) + aes(y=row_num,x=col_num, label = as.character(name),
                        check_overlap=TRUE, hjust=0) + geom_text() + 
  theme_minimal() + xlim(1,7) + theme(axis.text = element_blank(), 
                                      axis.title = element_blank(), 
                                      panel.background = element_blank())
```

## Gratitude Code

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
library(tidyverse)
gratitude <- readr::read_csv("gratitude.csv") |> arrange(First)
col_num <- rep(1:6, each=21)[1:nrow(gratitude)]
row_num <- rep(seq(1:21), 6)[1:nrow(gratitude)]
gratitude <- gratitude |> mutate(name=paste(First, Last), col_num = col_num, row_num=-row_num) 

ggplot(gratitude) + aes(y=row_num,x=col_num, label = as.character(name), check_overlap=TRUE, hjust=0) + geom_text() + theme_minimal() + xlim(1,7) +
  theme(axis.text = element_blank(), axis.title = element_blank(), panel.background = element_blank())
