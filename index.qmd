## TL; DR

- You all are smart and brilliant people
- Don’t beat yourself up while learning
- Find your crew who you can learn with safely
- When possible, make things public

## My Advice to Grow as a Data Scientist

1. Have Values
2. Meet people 
3. Learn Things Together
4. Build Things Together
5. Take Care of Yourself
6. Share Things in Public

# 1.  Have Values

## Why Values?

- Values help you say yes
- Values Help you say no 

## My Values

- Curiosity (about learning and others)
- Compassion (for myself and others)

## There is more than one path

- Question the PI model
- Collaboration is the most important

## Be Compassionate and Gentle With Yourself

- Data Science is Hard
- Don’t Replay Negative Tapes
- Find people to Learn With

## Learning Self-Talk from Students

> It’s okay not to know how to do something, practice makes perfect!

> It will be hard to learn, but so much fun and worth it.

> Dedicate couple hours for practice a day

## Learning Self-Talk

> It's going to be okay, it's really overwhelming right now but Ted is patient and thorough. 

> It's a good thing that you're looking at multiple sources of information about R (i.e. a brief Code Academy stint, the KCRB R4DS group, R Bootcamp links), it will just serve to solidify the topics that get covered. 

> Don't forget to Google, remember to ask questions.


## This is What it Takes

## The 5 minute rule for learning

- If something doesn't make sense, take a walk or a break and come back to it.

## It's Dangerous to Learn Alone

::::{.columns}

# 3. Learn Things Together

## Compassion = Psychological Safety

> Psychological safety is being able to show and employ one's self without fear of negative consequences of self-image, status or career.

## Psychological Safety -> Effective Learning

You need to find it for yourself

## Start or Join a Group!

- Find your like minded peers
- Help each other learn
- Find groups that have Codes of Conduct

## Why are Codes of Conduct Important?

- Establish the tone for the group
- States unacceptable behavior

## Example: OHSU BioData Club

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- Started as a group that wanted to learn more data science
- Everyone is Equal (PhD, Postdoc, Faculty)
- Working through problems together

## Testimony

>  Having [you] talk over the content providing examples and also answering student related questions was really helpful to see how some queries I had, others were having, which you explained, sometimes even providing more than one solution. Thanks very much. I have developed a passion for R.
