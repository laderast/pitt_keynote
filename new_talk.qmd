## TL;DR

- You all are smart and brilliant people
- Don’t beat yourself up while learning
- Find your crew who you can learn with safely
- When possible, make things public

## My Advice to Grow as a Data Scientist

1. Have Values
2. Meet people 
3. Learn Things Together
4. Build Things Together
5. Take Care of Yourself
6. Share Things

# 1.  Have Values

## Why Values?

- Values help you say yes
- Values Help you say no 

## My Values

- Curiosity (about learning and others)
- Compassion (for myself and others)

## There is more than one path

- Question the PI model
- Collaboration is the most important

## Be Compassionate and Gentle With Yourself

- Data Science is Hard
- Don’t Replay Negative Tapes
- FInd people to Learn With


# 2. Meet People

## Who Should You Meet?

- Potential Collaborators
- Potential Employers
- "Weak Ties"

## An Introvert’s Guide to Networking

- Networking is not about promoting yourself
- It’s about being curious about other people
- Finding common ground and seeing if you want to work with them

[How to Network in a Non-slimy Way](https://laderast.github.io/articles/2021-09-13-how-to-network-in-a-non-slimy-way/how-to-network-in-a-non-slimy-way.html)

## Be Curious About Other People

- Practice Informational Interviewing
- Don't overthink your questions
- Be genuinely interested in what people do
- Don't limit yourself to your field

## Do or Attend Lightning Talks!

- Lightning talk: 5-10 minute invitation to chat
- Best way to advertise what you're interested in
- Best way to meet people with your same interests

## Volunteer at Conferences
